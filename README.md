Neighborhood Map Project

NEIGHBORHOOD MAP PROJECT
- Develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood. Add additional functionality to this map (highlighted locations and third-pary data about those locations and various ways to browse the content).
- This tour application is complex enough and has a variety of data points. It can be tough to manage, so use frameworks, libraries and APIs to make the process more manageable.
- Interacting with API servers is a primary function of Front-End Developers
- Using 3rd party libraries is also a standard and encouraged process
- You will learn how design patterns assist in developing a manageable codebase, how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application, and provide a number of utilities for you to use. Implement third-party APIs that provide valuable data sets that can improve the quality of your application.
